# Fishing out TF cooperativity patterns from Deep Learning models

This repository contains a reimplementation of BPNet using pytorch and a submodule to construct synthetic dataset to test BPNet interpretations. 

Project to do: 
- (Following few weeks) Finish implementation of BPNet loss functions 
- (Following few weeks) Test on the theft data
- (Before summer) Extend the synthetic dataset subpackage to generate also profiles (use a generative model? using a gaussian process?)
- (Summer) Asses pairwise cooperativities?
