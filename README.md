# Fishing out TF cooperativity patterns from Deep Learning models

This repository contains a reimplementation of BPNet with PyTorch. The implementation is heavily based on BPreveal. 
The submodule synthetic_tf_binding was developed by @diego-carc as a suite for creating biophysically informed synthetic datase of Transcription Factor binding. 





# Todo:

Project to do: 
- (Following few weeks) Finish implementation of BPNet loss functions 
- (Following few weeks) Test on the theft data
- (Before summer) Extend the synthetic dataset subpackage to generate also profiles (use a generative model? using a gaussian process?)
- (Summer) Asses pairwise cooperativities?
